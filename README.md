# BodyPostures-Detector
This is my first deep learning project, where I use PoseNet to detect and analyze body postures. The project showcases how AI can be applied to real-world tasks such as fitness tracking, rehabilitation, and more. It's a practical introduction to human pose estimation and offers insights into the capabilities of deep learning in computer vision.
